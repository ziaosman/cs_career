Algorithm:
- Set of rules a computer follows to solves a problem, perform a calculation, or process data. 

Big O Notation:

- Runtime of algorithm is expressed in Big O
- N represents number of operations, it defines the growth of operations of an alogirhtm and not the speed in a unit
- Establishes the worst case scenario
- O(log n) - log time, ex: binary search
- O(n) - linear time, ex: simple search
- O(n * log n) - fast sorting algorithms, ex:quick sort
- O(n^2) - slow sorting alogrithm, ex: selection sort
- O(n!) - factorial time, ex: traveling salesperson
